# PYF5Functions
Functions for the PY F5 Project (Predicting F5 lines with advanced PY and AY lines). 
Mostly wrappers for the mixed.solve and the kin.blup functions in Endelman (2011) rrBLUP package.
When selecting with the genetic algorithm, I used the STPGA package by Deniz Akdemir (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/STPGA/index.html).
